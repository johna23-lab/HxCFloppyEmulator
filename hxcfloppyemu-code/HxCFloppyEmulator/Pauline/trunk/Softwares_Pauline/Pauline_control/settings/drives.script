# Pauline drives configuration file
#

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# To setup a drive you need to set its "Motor on" and "Select" lines.
#
# You can use up to 4 Shugart drives or up to 2 PC drives.
# See the notes if you want to mixup Shugart and PC drives on the same bus.
#
# --- Shugart Floppy disk drives ---
#
# Shugart drives can have 4 differents select lines and 1 motor line.
# The motor-on is common to all floppy drive on the same bus.
#
# Possible Shugart select lines (one per drive !) :
# DRIVES_PORT_DS0, DRIVES_PORT_DS1 , DRIVES_PORT_DS2 , DRIVES_PORT_DS3
#
# --- PC Floppy disk drives ---
#
# PC drives can have 2 differents settings :
# - Drive "A:"
# Select Line : DRIVES_PORT_DRVSA
# Motor  Line : DRIVES_PORT_MOTEA
#
# - Drive "B:"
# Select Line : DRIVES_PORT_DRVSB
# Motor  Line : DRIVES_PORT_MOTEB
#
# --- Notes  ---
# -> Note 1 :
# Please note that some pins names are aliased :
#
# DRIVES_PORT_DS0, DRIVES_PORT_MOTEA and DRIVES_PORT_PIN10 point to the same pin 10.
# DRIVES_PORT_DS1, DRIVES_PORT_DRVSB and DRIVES_PORT_PIN12 point to the same pin 12.
# DRIVES_PORT_DS2, DRIVES_PORT_DRVSA and DRIVES_PORT_PIN14 point to the same pin 14.
# DRIVES_PORT_MOTON, DRIVES_PORT_MOTEB and DRIVES_PORT_PIN16 point to the same pin 16.
# DRIVES_PORT_DS3 and DRIVES_PORT_PIN6 point to the same pin 6.
#
# -> Note 2 :
#
# - PC and Shugart drives installed on the same floppy bus.
#
# You can install Shugart and PC drive on the same bus in some conditions to
# avoid signal conflict :
#
# Working case 1 :
#
# PC drive as "A:" (DRIVES_PORT_DRVSA + DRIVES_PORT_MOTEA)
# Shugart drives can be installed on DS1 (DRIVES_PORT_DS1 + DRIVES_PORT_MOTON)
# and on DS3 (DRIVES_PORT_DS3 + DRIVES_PORT_MOTON).
#
# Working case 2 :
#
# PC drive as "B:" (DRIVES_PORT_DRVSB + DRIVES_PORT_MOTEB)
# Shugart drives can be installed on DS0 (DRIVES_PORT_DS0 + DRIVES_PORT_MOTON),
# on DS2 (DRIVES_PORT_DS2 + DRIVES_PORT_MOTON),
# and on DS3 (DRIVES_PORT_DS3 + DRIVES_PORT_MOTON).
#
# -> Note 3 :
#
# - Twisted PC floppy ribbon
#   A twisted PC floppy ribbon exchange the drive A and drive B select
#   and motor signals.
#   You can use Shugart drives with a twisted PC floppy ribbon but remember
#   that you may have to "mirror" your settings (DS0 become Motor-on,
#   DS1 become DS2, Motor-on become DS0)
#   If the drive is behind a twist you can use these aliases to setup it :
#
#   Shugart drives:
#
#   DRIVES_PORT_DS0_TWISTED_RIBBON
#   DRIVES_PORT_DS1_TWISTED_RIBBON
#   DRIVES_PORT_DS2_TWISTED_RIBBON
#   DRIVES_PORT_MOTON_TWISTED_RIBBON
#
#   PC drives:
#
#   DRIVES_PORT_DRVSA_TWISTED_RIBBON
#   DRIVES_PORT_MOTEA_TWISTED_RIBBON
#
#   DRIVES_PORT_DRVSB_TWISTED_RIBBON
#   DRIVES_PORT_MOTEB_TWISTED_RIBBON
