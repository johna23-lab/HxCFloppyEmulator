18 July 2020 :

	- Nexperia 5V 74LVC06 buffers replaced by standard TTL 74LS06 buffers :

		From the Nexperia 74LVC06 datasheet it appears that these buffers have a too high
		Vih input threshold (0.7*5V = 3.5V) for the FPGA 3.3V logic level when powered at
		5V. Using a classic 74LS06 fix this possible issue since the TTL Vih threshold is
		at 2.0V and this also bring a higher current driving capability (40mA vs 30mA).

		A question you may ask :

		<<I already have a Pauline with Nexperia 74LVC06 drivers, should i replace them ?>>

		I did some tests and measurements and it appears that Nexperia 74LVC06's real
		threshold value is lower than the value stated in the datasheet: with VCC at 5V
		it appears to be at 2.8V and with VCC at 5.5V it appears to be at 3.0V.
		The DE10 FPGA output level is a good 3.3V voltage. The margin is not huge, but
		it is large enough to perform reliable operations within the DE10 normal operating
		voltage range (4.75V <> 5.25V).
		Until now no issue was reported or detected with the Paulines with Nexperia
		74LVC06 drivers.
		To sum up : I don't think that Paulines with Nexperia 74LVC06 need to be modified.
