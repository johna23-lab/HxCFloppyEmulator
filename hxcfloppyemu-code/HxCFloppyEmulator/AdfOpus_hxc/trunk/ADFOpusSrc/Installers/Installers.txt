
ADF Opus Installers
-------------------

To build the installers you will need the following software:


GUiPeX
http://www.blueorbsoft.com/guipex/

UPX
http://upx.sourceforge.net/

GUiPeX is a front-end for the free UPX executable compresser. Before creating the release installer package,
ADFOpus.exe is compressed with GUiPeX. Compression results in a 64% size reduction in version 1 of ADF Opus.
Not compressing the executable will not effect creation of the installer package itself, you'll just have a
bigger file.

You could automate compression as a post-build step in VC++, using the smaller command line version of UPX
if you like. I haven't done this at this stage so that compression remains optional but I may do so in the
future and add UPX to the package. Who knows?


Ghost Installer Free Edition
http:/www.ginstall.com

The package name defaults to Setup.exe. Once a package is created, I manually rename it to its release name to
avoid it being overwritten by the other package. The free edition doesn't include this as an automatic option.



The installer scripts search upwards through the directory heirarchy so that no file copying or duplication is
required. Reproducing the release packages only requires you to install the source, build the release version,
compress ADFOpus.exe and run the scripts. Don't forget to rename or move the first package you create before
creating the second.

Have fun,

Gary.
