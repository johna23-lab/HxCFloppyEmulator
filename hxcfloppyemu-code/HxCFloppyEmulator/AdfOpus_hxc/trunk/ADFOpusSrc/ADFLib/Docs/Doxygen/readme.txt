
Doxygen Documentation For The ADF Library
-----------------------------------------

Doxgen is a freely available documentation system capable of creating HTML, LaTeX, Windows Compiled Help,
RTF and other formats from the same source. HTML documentation is provided with ADFLib due to its universal
nature. Start reading the docs by opening index.html found in the HTML sub-directory of the directory in which
you found this text file or ADFLib.html in the root directory.

If you would like to compile the docs yourself and/or generate the different formats available, you will
need the Doxygen distribution which can be found at http://www.doxygen.org. Pointing Doxygen at the doxyfile
found alongside this file will create the default HTML docs.
