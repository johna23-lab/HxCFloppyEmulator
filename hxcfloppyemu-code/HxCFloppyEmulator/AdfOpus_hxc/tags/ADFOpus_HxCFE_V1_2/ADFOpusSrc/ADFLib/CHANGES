17NOV02
- Version 0.7.9d.
- Doxygen documentation.
- Documented all functions presented in ADFLib.h as "the API".
- Added a copy of the GNU GPL to the docs dir, as this wasn't included.
- Added several missing copyright headers.
- Changed some return values declared in adf_dump.h to RETVAL to match the actual function declaration.
- Re-enabled Laurent's original debug console output, allowing conditional compilation with:
  #ifdef _DEBUG_PRINTF_
     ...
  #endif /*_DEBUG_PRINTF_*/

  Declaring _DEBUG_PRINTF_ in your compiler's preprocessor definitions for ADFLib will enable
  debug console output. This declaration is not made by default to avoid console problems
  for those not using the console.
- Some minor code cleanup.
- Added a master HTML page to the root directory. This just mega-refreshes to the Doxygen
  main page but avoids having to search through the doc directory heirarchy and brings together
  all documentation in the package under one umbrella.
- Added detailed documentation to struct declarations based on ADF and Amiga floppy disk
  format docs.

16OCT02
- Version 0.7.9c.
- Reinstated dynlib, dynunadf and staticunadf.
- Release output files now go to Bin/Win32/Release, rather than Bin/Win32, for
  symmetry and standardisation. Intermediate files still go to Release and Debug.
- Debug dynunadf and staticunadf now use the debug libs, not the release ones,
  to allow full debugger access.
- Fixed a path setting problem which caused a failure to find adflibd.lib.
- Removed C++ comment tags and replaced them with C tags across the board. ADFLib should
  hopefully be pure C again now.
- Removed a change implemented for Opus which was inadvertantly left in during earlier updates
  i.e. a string added to struct nativeDevice in adf_nativ.h.
