B=Bugfix
S=Specification changed
P=Performance gain
M=Memory gain
F=New Feature

Start (V0.1)

B A symbol and it's indirected counterpart cannot be used both - fixed.

B __stdio.c used the wrong flag for testing if filehandle has to be closed
  so the standard filehandle was closed three times - fixed.

P memchr.c changed - the C code looks not very good, but the assembler
  code is very smart now.

F Half initialized local arrays reference bzero() - added.

M malloc now rounds even _MSTEP up to full MMU page.

P strcat(),strncat(),strcpy(),strncpy(),strchr(),strrchr() rewritten in asm.

B strcmp(),strncmp() work on signed char - fixed.

P Removed __chkabort() in fgetc() and fputc() - it's not necessary to poll
  CTRL-C for EVERY character written.

B Extraneous semicolon (';') in freopen() deleted.

M Changed the code for setting buffer flags in setvbuf().

B setvbuf() should set the buffer size ;-) - fixed.

S _main() has the commandline as argument INCLUDING the program's name.
  Had to change the interface - easiest way was to rename _main as __submain
  and write a new __submain calling _main. Moved the call to open
  the shared libraries out of the startups, too.

S The private library bases now have two '_'.

B libm.a needs the private library bases, too.

S Some changes for Gerhard's gerlib: All I/O functions now run over
  a unix-alike interface. The standard I/O streams now use fopen.

F Added setbuffer() to be able to compile gas1.38 .

F changed 'static char *errorlist[]' to 'char *sys_errlist[]' for better
  compatibility. Added 'int sys_nerr' too :-P.

F Rewrote documentation & some new chapters in texinfo format.

F Changed the directory structure to the distribution form.
  Added a 'distribution' makefile entry.

V0.2

B Adjusted global makefile for auto detach startups.

F specs file added.

F The gcc frontend has libgcc.a hardcoded. Added a stub libgcc.a to get
  specs file to work.

B gas writes EOF and expects it to be handled as 0xff - fixed.

B Symbol redirections didn't work the way I expected - removed most of them.

B -lm links libm.a BEFORE libnix. Moved some functions.

B vfscanf() does no longer ungetc EOF.

M Optimized __udivsi3, __umodsi3, __divsi3, __modsi3, div, ldiv.

F Some functions added to libamiga.a.

V0.3

B strtod() gave a warning - fixed.

B strftime() didn't count correctly - fixed.

M Optimized atan2, fmod, strlen.

B Bug in makefile for the math libraries  - fixed.

F The low level standard-I/O functions are now posix compliant.

F access(), stricmp(), unlink(), fstat(), bcmp() added.

V0.4

B Fixed bug in fstat().

B Bugs in fread() and fwrite() when processing no data at all - fixed.

P Added an inline version of strlen() in vfprintf, vsscanf, strxfrm, setlocale.

M Rewrote all stub functions as symbol redirections to a single one.

F strcasecmp() added.

S moved __modsi3, __umodsi3 into the div-equivalents.

B A missing locale.library should not cause a program exit - fixed.

B asctime used 'c' instead of 'C' - fixed.

B strftime didn't work correctly on numbers longer than 2 characters - fixed.

B Some additional work on the low level I/O needed.

S Did some work on the startups.

S The auto-detach startups had some holes. I removed them
  from distribution until I get a better method :'(.

V0.5

F Added Open("*",MODE_NEWFILE) as a fallback for process->pr_CES.

F strdup, stricmp, strlower, strnicmp, strupper added.

(first official release)

M Changed the kludge in the library startup module.

F Added optional support for Un*x style pathnames.

B Bug in the low-level-I/O cleanup function fixed.

B Yet another bug in strftime() fixed.

M Optimized the standard I/O initialization.

S Changed the disk layout for better handling of different library compilations.

B The glue code generator didn't work correctly on void-'...'-functions - fixed.

B Bug in freopen when using mode "w" on a already existing file fixed.

S Cleaned the __initlibraries function up.

F Hook and boopsi functions added to libamiga.a.

B The commandline parser overwrote the __commandline variable
  (this is not a real bug but a NASTY feature) - fixed.

F Auto-detach reintegrated (clean this time) as an object module.

F FastRand and RangeRand added to libamiga.a.

B LocaleBase was defined twice - fixed.

B Moved __decimalpoint from libm.a into libnix.a.

F Added 3.1 system libraries to libstubs.a.

F Added Un*x functions (mkdir,chdir,rmdir,getwd,getcwd,opendir,readdir,closedir)

S main and _exit implemented with symbol redirection. This gives full C++ support
  with libg++.a.

F Added support for shared amiga-library creation (library and device initcode)

V0.6

F Added a stackswap-module

S Changed stat() to work silently (now suppresses all *DOS* requesters)

B Fixed a bug in __swbuf() - overrun buffersize by one character, oops...

B __chkabort() didn't clear ctrl-c signal - fixed

S signal handling heavily changed - now more unix-like

F Added default values to libstubs.a for some by certain modules used variables
  (__stack, _procname, __priority)

S moved redirection of 'main' to '_main' into a separate file (in libnix_main.a)

B improved precision of vfprintf.

B fixed returncode of vfscanf on EOF

F version string added to libnix.a

V0.7 (second official release)

B fseek didn't clear the EOF flag.

S Dropped the ChangeMode call in open(). Now mode "a" files have a shared lock,
  but the other method didn't work with all handlers :-(.

B Made fread() and fwrite() buffered.

S Got rid of those ARexx-scripts when building the library :-). Now you can
  build libnix on a sun using a cross-compiler.

B Fixed some holes in the commandline parser that could give empty arguments.

F Prepared startups for the third argument of main(int argc,char *argv[],char *env[]).
  It's not supported, but you could now ;-).

B Fixed a bug in the floating point part of vprintf (introduced with the last
  revision :-( ).

F fileno() and fdtofh() added.

F Version string added to ALL the modules - let's see if this hack works :-).

V0.8 (third official release)

B Fixed the returncode of close(STDIN_FILENO) and errno after lseek().

B fflush(NULL) flushed stdout and stderr twice - fixed.

B Fixed a bug in atan2().

F All libnix requesters now check pr_WindowPtr first.

S Moved __chkabort() one level down into read(), write(), lseek().

B Fixed missing terminator in strncat().

F Added code to handle stackextension/checking :-).

S Changed all includes to use proto/ instead of inline/

V0.9

B ANSI demands flushing of line or unbuffered output files write reading from
  line buffered input.

B Fixed the bug that wrote weird characters for floats on some machines -
  the system math libraries don't work correct if you open them in alphabetical
  order (like the computer generated libstubs.a did - thanks ls :-( ).

M Optimized the commandline parsers and shared library opener.

M Removed some unused prototypes in C-files.

V1.0

B If no characters are read gets() should return NULL. Dropped unnecessary
  ferror() call in fgets by the way.

B strtoul() read characters which were invalid for the current base.

S switched from fputs() to write(2,..) in raise()

F addded a bunch of non-ansi function (mktemp,getrusage,etc.)

F snprintf() and vsnprintf() added.

F Added CPU check with error requester for the non-68000 versions (changed
  startups, too).

V1.1b

B fixed longjmp() not returning 1 if passed a 0

M changed automatic library opening once again ;-(
  (moved openliberror() function into __initlibraries source)

P tweaked string functions and removed some asm versions

P updated headers/strsup.h with new string functions

F moved all 1.3 compatibility stuff into a separate lib called libnix13.a
  (contains integer math functions eg. useful for linking with -nostdlib)

S added some const qualifiers at several places

F tweaked libamiga.a functions

F rewrote libinit.c, libinitr.c and devinit.c
  (requires ADE/GG GCC 2.7.2.1 or up)

F added three math functions from vc.lib: frexp.c, ldexp.c and modf.c

B fixed serious bug in atol() and atoi()

S added "/WAIT" to default stdiowin options
  (suggested by Martin Hauner)

V1.2

S updated headers/strsup.h once again

F added fdopen() (required changes in freopen())

B fixed auto-initilization of init_stk.c
  (broken since 1.2)

B fixed bug in mktime() (tm_mday starts with 1!)
  (reported by Detlef Wuerkner)

S modified rename() according to man-page

S __seterrno() does map rename() error now
  (was disabled!?)

V1.3

F added networking support based on initial work by Jeff Sheperd
  (supports AmiTCP and AS225 compatible stacks)

B strftime() formats for date and date/time were swapped
  (apparently this was due to an outdated manpage...)

B fixed incorrect types usage with proper system types
  (makes the library better prepared for PPC ;-)

P improved memset(), bcopy() and bzero()
  (hopefully ;-)

B fixed (harmless?) bug in freopen() open mode handling
  (did only handle rwa[b]+ but not rwa+[b])

B fixed append filemode to really write at end of file only

S changed fdopen() to be independed from freopen()

S stdin/stdout/stderr initialization now use fdopen()
  (-> removed freopen()'s stdio open kludge)

S adapted chmod() to return success if SetProtection
  fails because source is locked

F finally rewrote devinit.c to use GCC 2.7.2.1 features
  (now in sync with libinit.c/libinitr.c)

B fixed Makefiles for case sensitives filesystems, cross
  compilation support (dosesn't use ar directly anymore)
  and proper $(MAKE) handling

B fixed hole in math/Makefile.in :-(
  (didn't reference *all* objects leading to vfprint/vfscanf)

F added a better and more general debug scheme

F added gettimeofday() from libnixPPC package

S general code cleanup
  (eg. replaced all numerical stdio flags with #defines)

V2.0
