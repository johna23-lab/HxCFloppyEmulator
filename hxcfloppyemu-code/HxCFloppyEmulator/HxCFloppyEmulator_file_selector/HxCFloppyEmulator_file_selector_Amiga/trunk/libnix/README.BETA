This is BETA 2 of libnix and its considered final. Changes compared with
the previous BETA are completed append mode (now works for fdopen()),
stderr behavoir according to the standard (always unbuffered; previosly
it had the normal fopen() mode) since write-only streams are now optimized
(as in *BSD ;-). The internal socket i/o interface was changed for better
system compatibility (used a packet in private memory, now its DOS alloced)
The only change that I consider is a makefile change: changing the 
optimization level from -O3 to -O2 or -Os.

This libnix version is BETA!!! The final version will certainly contain
changes compared to this snapshot.
Its intended for those who are interested and are able to recompile the
libraries. This packaged can be compiled under a cross compiler environment.
The configure script MUST be invoked through an absolute pathname! If you
configure it with a relative pathname you have to modify VPATH and srcdir
in startup/Makefile (remove the first ../).

libnix 2.0 finally offers support for networking. The network support is
in a new link library called libsocket.a. This code is based on work by
Jeff Sheperd. For a more changes consult sources/history. The list is
probably no complete.
